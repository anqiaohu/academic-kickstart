# Abstract.
abstract = "Safety has become extremely important, even when the market is demanding faster charging of mobile batteries. Single-chip battery chargers cannot safely deliver the current needed because power density will exceed the package limit and create thermal hot spots. Therefore, a master-slave battery charging system using parallel DC-DC converters is presented. The master charger acts as a voltage or current source, and multiple slave chargers are turned on and off by the master as current sources. With it, the heat is spread out into multiple locations on the PCB, effectively eliminating thermal hot spots. With one slave, the constant-current (CC) phase charging time was reduced by 46%. With two slaves, thermal hot spots temperature were reduced by 15C. Designed as a switch-mode current source, the slave charger achieved 4% current accuracy (6-σ), and 92% peak efficiency from 5-9V input, 0.5-3A output range. It occupies 3.9 mm2 in a 0.18 μm BCD process."
