# Abstract.
abstract = "Ultra low quiescent, wide output current range low-dropout regulators (LDO) are in high demand in portable applications to extend battery lives. This paper presents a 500 nA quiescent, 0 to 100 mA load, 3.5-7 V input to 3 V output LDO in a digital 0.35 μm 2P3M CMOS technology. The challenges in designing with nano-ampere of quiescent current are discussed, namely the leakage, the parasitics, and the excessive DC gain. CMOS super source follower voltage buffer and input excessive gain reduction are then proposed. The LDO is internally compensated using Ahuja method with a minimum phase margin of 55° across all load conditions. The maximum transient voltage variation is less than 150 and 75 mV when used with 1 and 10 μF external capacitor. Compared with existing work, this LDO achieves the best transient flgure-of-merit with close to best dynamic current efficiency (maximum-to-quiescent current ratio)."
